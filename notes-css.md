# CSS Notes

- `margin: y-axis x-axis z-axis`: borders around the element
- `padding: y-axis x-axis z-axis`: borders inside the element

```css
div {
/* This will make display stretch the window size */
display: flex;
/* This will arrange the elements within the div in columns (one below the other) */
flex-direction: column;
}
```

```css
img {
  width: 100%
}
/* This will take up 100% of the width of the parent element in which img resides and no more - good to contain */
```
